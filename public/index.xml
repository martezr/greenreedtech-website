      <description>Security of a HashiCorp Vault deployment is of paramount importance given the sensitive nature of the information contained within the platform. Policies within the platform are used to grant and deny access to the sensitive information stored in the platform.
All operations in HashiCorp Vault are audited and can be shipped to a centralized logging server.</description>

      <description>How do we verify that the Terraform binary we download is the same as the one HashiCorp produced?
Ensuring the integrity of software is important to help prevent a malicious actor from tricking us into using a modified version of Terraform as well as ensuring the version we&amp;rsquo;re using isn&amp;rsquo;t corrupted.</description>

      <guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/hashicorp-terraform-code-signing/</guid>
      <description>Signing software has become critically important given the recent supply chain attacks. How do we verify that the software we&amp;rsquo;re downloading is actually created by who believe created the software? In this case we want to ensure that the Terraform binary we&amp;rsquo;re downloading was created by HashiCorp. This helps prevent a scenario where a malicious actor tricks you into downloading a compromised version of Terraform.</description>

      <description>Containerization and Kubernetes have dominated the IT conversation for the last handful of years. Containers enable rapid development, application portability and a myriad of other benefits. Containers rely on a host operating system in order to run and ideally it would be one that is extremely lightweight since the apps running in the containers are what we really care about.</description>

      <title>Enabling Cloud Workload Identity for vSphere Virtual Machines</title>
      <link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/enabling-cloud-workload-identity-for-vsphere-virtual-machines/</link>

      <guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/enabling-cloud-workload-identity-for-vsphere-virtual-machines/</guid>
      <description>One of the major benefits of using the public cloud is the integrated identity and access management (IAM). This simplifies the process of granting workloads access to other cloud services. Think about how an AWS EC2 instance is granted access to write objects to an S3 bucket. An IAM role is assigned to the instance which has a policy that grants the S3 access.</description>

      <description>HashiCorp Vault supports several authentication methods for human and non-human access. Several of the non-human authentication methods are tied to specific platforms or clouds such as AWS, Kubernetes, Azure, and others. For workloads that are running on non-supported platforms, the AppRole authentication method is typically recommended for authentication. The AppRole method uses a role as the core construct as the name implies.</description>

      <description>Network booting operating systems isnâ€™t a new concept and has been around for years. Bare metal deployments are typically where network booting is commonly used. Most network cards are equipped with a network boot rom that enables the server to boot from the network using the PXE protocol. The PXE protocol is an old protocol that offers limited functionality.</description>

      <guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/hashicorp-vault-vsphere-authentication-with-vmware-event-broker-appliance-veba/</guid>
      <description>HashiCorp Vault supports a number of authentication methods including methods that utilize what HashiCorp refers to as a &amp;ldquo;trusted platform&amp;rdquo;. These include public clouds such as AWS, Azure and GCP along with platforms like Kubernetes. This method of authentication simplifies the introduction of the initial credential or secret that a workload must present to Vault by making use of information about itself that it already knows.</description>

      <description>The VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA) fling is a really interesting project that enables administrators to take advantage of event driven automation in a VMware vSphere environment. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to kick the tires on using the appliance as I&amp;rsquo;ve thought a lot about vSphere event driven security and what that looks like from a technical implementation perspective.</description>

      <title>Identifying Active HashiCorp Vault Root Tokens</title>
      <link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/identifying-active-hashicorp-vault-root-tokens/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/identifying-active-hashicorp-vault-root-tokens/</guid>
      <description>Revoking the root token on a production HashiCorp Vault deployment is one of the recommended best practices for securing an instance of HashiCorp Vault. The actual process to revoke the root token is fairly straightforward by running the vault token revoke command and providing the root token at the command line.</description>

      <title>Detecting HashiCorp Vault Root Token Generation</title>
      <link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/detecting-hashicorp-vault-root-token-generation/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/detecting-hashicorp-vault-root-token-generation/</guid>
      <description>HashiCorp Vault generates a default root token during installation and best practice dictates that the token should be revoked once the deployment has been setup. There are certain critical operations that can only be carried out by a root token and requires that a new root token be generated. Given the immense power that the root token garners it would be ideal to identify when a root token is generated.</description>

      <guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/detecting-hashicorp-vault-root-login/</guid>
      <description>Security of a HashiCorp Vault deployment is of paramount importance given the sensitive nature of the information contained within the platform. During the initial configuration process the root token is used to perform the setup and should be used to create less privileged named accounts. These accounts should be used for day to day administration of the Vault deployment and the root token should only be used in scenarios where it is absolutely necessary.</description>

      <description>Treating workloads as &amp;ldquo;cattle&amp;rdquo; or immutable is a popular management paradigm for stateless workloads and is especially prevalent for such workloads that are hosted in a public cloud. The concept is based upon the notion that servers are pre-baked with all of the software that is needed for the application and any stateful data is pushed to an external persistent storage mechanism such as an object storage or a message queue.</description>

      <description>Template management is a critical facet of infrastructure management and traditionally one of the more challenging operations there is. The advent of tools like HashiCorp Packer have provided administrators with the ability declaratively automate the template creation process.
Automation is great but in most organizations a single piece of automation is part of a larger process that includes tickets and potentially other hand offs.</description>

      <description>Vault (https://www.vaultproject.io/) is a secrets management tool created by HashiCorp that is extremely popular. Given the sensitive nature of the data being stored by a Vault server it is critical that auditing be configured appropriately to provide a record of who accessed sensitive data and when it was accessed. In this blog post we&amp;rsquo;ll walk through configuring a Vault server for auditing and dump the log entries to an AWS S3 bucket for centralized storage.</description>

      <description>What is immutable infrastructure? Immutable infrastructure is the concept of utilizing an infrastructure component in an ephemeral manner. This means that the component can be destroyed and recreated at will without major impact.
Advantages
 Troublesome instances can easily be destroyed and recreated. System patching processes are replaced by just provisioning instances from a new template.</description>
