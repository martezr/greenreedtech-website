The challenge for many similar companies is how do you continue to stay relevant given the pace at which technology moves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kubernetes is the defacto container orchestration platform created by Google that is one of the hottest technologies within the IT industry at this time. One of the still developing areas with containers is the management of stateful applications which for many is an anti-pattern for containers which they feel should be stateless.

&lt;p>One of the most intriguing presentations of the event was the presentation given by &lt;a href="https://www.veritas.com/">Veritas&lt;/a>. The CFD3 presentation was a mixed bag of good and not so good. One of the key takeaways for me was that sometimes the things you forget to highlight are some of the most intriguing to people. This post covers a number of Veritas products that weren&amp;rsquo;t covered during the presentations that really make the case for Veritas as a cloud company.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
