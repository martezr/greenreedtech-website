This simplifies the process of granting workloads access to other cloud services. Think about how an AWS EC2 instance is granted access to write objects to an S3 bucket. An IAM role is assigned to the instance which has a policy that grants the S3 access. This enables AWS CLI tools and application built upon the AWS SDK to access the bucket without explicitly providing credentials.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
