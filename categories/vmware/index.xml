&lt;p>VMware has been building out a cross-cloud solution that enables enterprise organizations to seamlessly deploy workloads to &amp;ldquo;any&amp;rdquo; cloud. This is being realized by building out operating environments in hyperscaler clouds such as AWS (VMC on AWS), Azure, GCP (Google Cloud VMware Engine), IBM Cloud (IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions), Oracle Cloud (Oracle Cloud VMware Solutions), and others. Each of these offerings is built using VMware&amp;rsquo;s SDDC solution which leverages vSphere for compute, vSAN for storage, and NSX for networking.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building a Lightweight Container Host for VMware vSphere</title><link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/building-a-lightweight-container-host-for-vmware-vsphere/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/building-a-lightweight-container-host-for-vmware-vsphere/</guid><description>&lt;p>Containerization and Kubernetes have dominated the IT conversation for the last handful of years. Containers enable rapid development, application portability and a myriad of other benefits. Containers rely on a host operating system in order to run and ideally it would be one that is extremely lightweight since the apps running in the containers are what we really care about.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VMware vSphere VM iPXE Boot without DHCP</title><link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/vmware-vsphere-vm-ipxe-boot-without-dhcp/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/vmware-vsphere-vm-ipxe-boot-without-dhcp/</guid><description>&lt;p>Network booting operating systems isn’t a new concept and has been around for years. Bare metal deployments are typically where network booting is commonly used. Most network cards are equipped with a network boot rom that enables the server to boot from the network using the PXE protocol. The PXE protocol is an old protocol that offers limited functionality. iPXE (&lt;a href="https://ipxe.org/">https://ipxe.org/&lt;/a>) is an open source network boot firmware that extends PXE with additional functionality. Network booting comes with a number of challenges, primarily configuring and managing the associated infrastructure required (DHCP, TFTP, etc.). TFTP isn’t typically used in most IT environments and DHCP isn’t commonly available on networks or VLANs used for hosting servers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creating a VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA) Golang Function</title><link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/creating-a-vmware-event-broker-appliance-veba-golang-function/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/creating-a-vmware-event-broker-appliance-veba-golang-function/</guid><description>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://vmweventbroker.io/">VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA)&lt;/a> fling is a really interesting project that enables administrators to take advantage of event driven automation in a VMware vSphere environment. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to kick the tires on using the appliance as I&amp;rsquo;ve thought a lot about vSphere event driven security and what that looks like from a technical implementation perspective. In this blog post we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at how to quickly get started with developing a Golang function for the VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA) that executes when a virtual machine is powered on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vRealize Orchestrator (vRO) and PostgreSQL Database SSL</title><link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/vrealize-orchestrator-vro-and-postgresql-database-ssl/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/vrealize-orchestrator-vro-and-postgresql-database-ssl/</guid><description>&lt;p>In a previous post we walked through configuring a PostgreSQL database server as the external database for our vRealize Orchestrator (vRO) cluster.

&lt;p>The first thing we need to do is get our SSL certificate for the database server. In this case we&amp;rsquo;re going to use openssl to generate our certificate request and ultimately we&amp;rsquo;ll use openssl self-sign the certificate.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vRealize Orchestrator (vRO) Cluster with a PostgreSQL Database</title><link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/vrealize-orchestrator-vro-cluster-with-a-postgresql-database/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/vrealize-orchestrator-vro-cluster-with-a-postgresql-database/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this post we&amp;rsquo;re going to build out a two node vRealize Orchestrator cluster with a PostgreSQL database. VMware is deprecating support for Microsoft SQL and Oracle databases as the vRO external database in favor of PostgreSQL.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A common scenario when working with any software is wanting to test against multiple versions of the software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this example we&amp;rsquo;re going to dynamically fetch the software version of StackStorm (&lt;a href="https://stackstorm.com/">https://stackstorm.com/&lt;/a>) from github so that we can select which version to install from the vRA request form.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vRealize Automation 7.2 hardening compliance with vRO and Splunk</title><link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/vrealize-automation-7.2-hardening-compliance-with-vro-and-splunk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/vrealize-automation-7.2-hardening-compliance-with-vro-and-splunk/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll walk through how we can utilize vRealize Orchestrator and Splunk to determine how compliant our vRA appliance is with the &lt;a href="https://pubs.vmware.com/vrealize-automation-72/topic/com.vmware.ICbase/PDF/vrealize-automation-72-hardening.pdf">vRealize Automation 7.2 hardening guide&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="vra-72-hardening-compliance-script">vRA 7.2 hardening compliance script&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The first task is utilizing a script to check the settings specified in the hardening guide. In our case we&amp;rsquo;re going to generate JSON output from the script in order to easily ingest the data into Splunk. We&amp;rsquo;re utilizing bash to avoid any dependencies upon other packages that aren&amp;rsquo;t part of the default appliance install.

There are already bots available from vendors such as opvizor (&lt;a href="http://www.opvizor.com/opbot/">http://www.opvizor.com/opbot/&lt;/a>) that provide this functionality in a productized solution.

&lt;p>A critical aspect of any Puppet deployment is determining how we want to allow nodes to get their certificate signed by the Puppet master. Before we delve into policy based autosigning we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the other three methods for managing certificate signing.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Manual&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Manually signing certs breaks automated deployment processes.&lt;/li>
