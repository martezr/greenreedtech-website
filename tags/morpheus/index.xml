Morpheus Data is a company that I became aware of during &lt;a href="https://techfieldday.com/event/cfd3/">Cloud Field Day 3 (CFD3)&lt;/a> while serving as a delegate for the event. Cloud Field Day is one of several events hosted by &lt;a href="https://gestaltit.com/">Gestalt IT&lt;/a> in which several vendors present one at a time to a group of IT professionals that ask questions and provide feedback about the presentations. I was intrigued by what was covered during the &lt;a href="https://techfieldday.com/appearance/morpheus-data-presents-at-cloud-field-day-3/">presentation&lt;/a>Â as it is a product that is right in my technical wheelhouse.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
