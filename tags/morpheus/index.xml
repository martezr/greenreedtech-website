Morpheus Data is a company that I became aware of during Cloud Field Day 3 (CFD3) while serving as a delegate for the event. Cloud Field Day is one of several events hosted by Gestalt IT in which several vendors present one at a time to a group of IT professionals that ask questions and provide feedback about the presentations.</description></item></channel></rss>
