How do we verify that the software we&amp;rsquo;re downloading is actually created by who believe created the software? In this case we want to ensure that the Terraform binary we&amp;rsquo;re downloading was created by HashiCorp. This helps prevent a scenario where a malicious actor tricks you into downloading a compromised version of Terraform.</description></item><item><title>Enabling Cloud Workload Identity for vSphere Virtual Machines</title><link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/enabling-cloud-workload-identity-for-vsphere-virtual-machines/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/enabling-cloud-workload-identity-for-vsphere-virtual-machines/</guid><description>One of the major benefits of using the public cloud is the integrated identity and access management (IAM). This simplifies the process of granting workloads access to other cloud services. Think about how an AWS EC2 instance is granted access to write objects to an S3 bucket. An IAM role is assigned to the instance which has a policy that grants the S3 access.</description></item><item><title>HashiCorp Vault Unique AppRole Identity Logging</title><link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/hashicorp-vault-unique-approle-identity-logging/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/hashicorp-vault-unique-approle-identity-logging/</guid><description>HashiCorp Vault supports several authentication methods for human and non-human access. Several of the non-human authentication methods are tied to specific platforms or clouds such as AWS, Kubernetes, Azure, and others. For workloads that are running on non-supported platforms, the AppRole authentication method is typically recommended for authentication. The AppRole method uses a role as the core construct as the name implies.</description></item><item><title>HashiCorp Vault vSphere Authentication with VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA)</title><link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/hashicorp-vault-vsphere-authentication-with-vmware-event-broker-appliance-veba/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/hashicorp-vault-vsphere-authentication-with-vmware-event-broker-appliance-veba/</guid><description>HashiCorp Vault supports a number of authentication methods including methods that utilize what HashiCorp refers to as a &amp;ldquo;trusted platform&amp;rdquo;. These include public clouds such as AWS, Azure and GCP along with platforms like Kubernetes. This method of authentication simplifies the introduction of the initial credential or secret that a workload must present to Vault by making use of information about itself that it already knows.</description></item><item><title>Identifying Active HashiCorp Vault Root Tokens</title><link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/identifying-active-hashicorp-vault-root-tokens/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/identifying-active-hashicorp-vault-root-tokens/</guid><description>Revoking the root token on a production HashiCorp Vault deployment is one of the recommended best practices for securing an instance of HashiCorp Vault. The actual process to revoke the root token is fairly straightforward by running the vault token revoke command and providing the root token at the command line.</description></item><item><title>Detecting HashiCorp Vault Root Token Generation</title><link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/detecting-hashicorp-vault-root-token-generation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/detecting-hashicorp-vault-root-token-generation/</guid><description>HashiCorp Vault generates a default root token during installation and best practice dictates that the token should be revoked once the deployment has been setup. There are certain critical operations that can only be carried out by a root token and requires that a new root token be generated. Given the immense power that the root token garners it would be ideal to identify when a root token is generated.</description></item><item><title>Detecting HashiCorp Vault Root Login</title><link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/detecting-hashicorp-vault-root-login/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/detecting-hashicorp-vault-root-login/</guid><description>Security of a HashiCorp Vault deployment is of paramount importance given the sensitive nature of the information contained within the platform. During the initial configuration process the root token is used to perform the setup and should be used to create less privileged named accounts. These accounts should be used for day to day administration of the Vault deployment and the root token should only be used in scenarios where it is absolutely necessary.</description></item><item><title>Vault Hardening Compliance using Chef InSpec</title><link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/vault-hardening-compliance-using-chef-inspec/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/vault-hardening-compliance-using-chef-inspec/</guid><description>HashiCorp Vault is quickly becoming the defacto secrets management platform used in environments that rely on DevOps concepts for application delivery. Vault is incredibly easy and simple to get started with but takes a bit of thought and planning to operationalize it.
One of the challenges is ensuring that the installation of your security platform is secure.</description></item><item><title>Vault Audit Logging</title><link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/vault-audit-logging/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/vault-audit-logging/</guid><description>Vault (https://www.vaultproject.io/) is a secrets management tool created by HashiCorp that is extremely popular. Given the sensitive nature of the data being stored by a Vault server it is critical that auditing be configured appropriately to provide a record of who accessed sensitive data and when it was accessed. In this blog post we&amp;rsquo;ll walk through configuring a Vault server for auditing and dump the log entries to an AWS S3 bucket for centralized storage.</description></item><item><title>vRealize Automation 7.2 hardening compliance with vRO and Splunk</title><link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/vrealize-automation-7.2-hardening-compliance-with-vro-and-splunk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/vrealize-automation-7.2-hardening-compliance-with-vro-and-splunk/</guid><description>In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll walk through how we can utilize vRealize Orchestrator and Splunk to determine how compliant our vRA appliance is with the vRealize Automation 7.2 hardening guide.
vRA 7.2 hardening compliance script The first task is utilizing a script to check the settings specified in the hardening guide. In our case we&amp;rsquo;re going to generate JSON output from the script in order to easily ingest the data into Splunk.</description></item></channel></rss>
