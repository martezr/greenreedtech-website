This was certainly evident based on the presentations at the &lt;a href="https://techfieldday.com/event/aifd4/">AI Field Day 4&lt;/a> event. The event provided an opportunity for various software and hardware vendors to present their AI related solutions to a group of delegates. The challenge that vendors often have is articulating a meaningful story without it coming off as though they are just sprinkling a little AI on an existing capability. The industry certainly saw a lot of this at the height of the Big Data, Machine Learning, and Blockchain hype cycles. I was interested in seeing if what was going to be presented was a &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; AI solution or primarily just an AI bolt-on.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
