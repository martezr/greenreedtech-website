&lt;p>VMware has been building out a cross-cloud solution that enables enterprise organizations to seamlessly deploy workloads to &amp;ldquo;any&amp;rdquo; cloud. This is being realized by building out operating environments in hyperscaler clouds such as AWS (VMC on AWS), Azure, GCP (Google Cloud VMware Engine), IBM Cloud (IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions), Oracle Cloud (Oracle Cloud VMware Solutions), and others. Each of these offerings is built using VMware&amp;rsquo;s SDDC solution which leverages vSphere for compute, vSAN for storage, and NSX for networking.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
