&lt;p>One of the most intriguing presentations of the event was the presentation given by &lt;a href="https://www.veritas.com/">Veritas&lt;/a>. The CFD3 presentation was a mixed bag of good and not so good. One of the key takeaways for me was that sometimes the things you forget to highlight are some of the most intriguing to people. This post covers a number of Veritas products that weren&amp;rsquo;t covered during the presentations that really make the case for Veritas as a cloud company.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
