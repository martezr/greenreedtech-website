Several of the non-human authentication methods are tied to specific platforms or clouds such as AWS, Kubernetes, Azure, and others. For workloads that are running on non-supported platforms, the AppRole authentication method is typically recommended for authentication. The AppRole method uses a role as the core construct as the name implies.</description></item><item><title>VMware vSphere VM iPXE Boot without DHCP</title><link>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/vmware-vsphere-vm-ipxe-boot-without-dhcp/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/vmware-vsphere-vm-ipxe-boot-without-dhcp/</guid><description>Network booting operating systems isnâ€™t a new concept and has been around for years. Bare metal deployments are typically where network booting is commonly used. Most network cards are equipped with a network boot rom that enables the server to boot from the network using the PXE protocol. The PXE protocol is an old protocol that offers limited functionality.</description></item><item><title>HashiCorp Vault vSphere Authentication with VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA)</title><link>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/hashicorp-vault-vsphere-authentication-with-vmware-event-broker-appliance-veba/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/hashicorp-vault-vsphere-authentication-with-vmware-event-broker-appliance-veba/</guid><description>HashiCorp Vault supports a number of authentication methods including methods that utilize what HashiCorp refers to as a &amp;ldquo;trusted platform&amp;rdquo;. These include public clouds such as AWS, Azure and GCP along with platforms like Kubernetes. This method of authentication simplifies the introduction of the initial credential or secret that a workload must present to Vault by making use of information about itself that it already knows.</description></item><item><title>Deployment Pipeline Chaos Engineering with StackStorm and ChaosToolkit</title><link>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/deployment-pipeline-chaos-engineering-with-stackstorm-and-chaostoolkit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/deployment-pipeline-chaos-engineering-with-stackstorm-and-chaostoolkit/</guid><description>Chaos Engineering is the practice of experimenting or injecting faults into a system to test how the system responds to the failure (https://principlesofchaos.org). Chaos Engineering is still new for many organizations and can be a daunting practice to adopt at first but even baby steps into the practice can be immediately beneficial.</description></item><item><title>Identifying Active HashiCorp Vault Root Tokens</title><link>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/identifying-active-hashicorp-vault-root-tokens/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/identifying-active-hashicorp-vault-root-tokens/</guid><description>Revoking the root token on a production HashiCorp Vault deployment is one of the recommended best practices for securing an instance of HashiCorp Vault. The actual process to revoke the root token is fairly straightforward by running the vault token revoke command and providing the root token at the command line.</description></item><item><title>Detecting HashiCorp Vault Root Token Generation</title><link>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/detecting-hashicorp-vault-root-token-generation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/detecting-hashicorp-vault-root-token-generation/</guid><description>HashiCorp Vault generates a default root token during installation and best practice dictates that the token should be revoked once the deployment has been setup. There are certain critical operations that can only be carried out by a root token and requires that a new root token be generated. Given the immense power that the root token garners it would be ideal to identify when a root token is generated.</description></item><item><title>Detecting HashiCorp Vault Root Login</title><link>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/detecting-hashicorp-vault-root-login/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/detecting-hashicorp-vault-root-login/</guid><description>Security of a HashiCorp Vault deployment is of paramount importance given the sensitive nature of the information contained within the platform. During the initial configuration process the root token is used to perform the setup and should be used to create less privileged named accounts. These accounts should be used for day to day administration of the Vault deployment and the root token should only be used in scenarios where it is absolutely necessary.</description></item><item><title>Puppet Bolt Vault Inventory Plugin</title><link>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/puppet-bolt-vault-inventory-plugin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/puppet-bolt-vault-inventory-plugin/</guid><description>In this blog post we&amp;rsquo;ll look at the HashiCorp Vault plugin for Puppet Bolt that enables authentication credentials for Bolt to be retrieved from an instance of HashiCorp Vault. HashiCorp Vault is a secrets management platform that is commonly used to store secrets such as API keys, passwords and SSH private keys.</description></item><item><title>Puppet Bolt Terraform Inventory Plugin</title><link>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/puppet-bolt-terraform-inventory-plugin/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/puppet-bolt-terraform-inventory-plugin/</guid><description>HashiCorp Terraform is a popular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that is used for provisioning virtual machines or cloud instances along with other resources. Once a virtual machine or cloud instance is provisioned typically it still needs to be configured which includes security baselines, application dependency configuration and even application deployment.</description></item><item><title>Vault Audit Logging</title><link>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/vault-audit-logging/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/vault-audit-logging/</guid><description>Vault (https://www.vaultproject.io/) is a secrets management tool created by HashiCorp that is extremely popular. Given the sensitive nature of the data being stored by a Vault server it is critical that auditing be configured appropriately to provide a record of who accessed sensitive data and when it was accessed. In this blog post we&amp;rsquo;ll walk through configuring a Vault server for auditing and dump the log entries to an AWS S3 bucket for centralized storage.</description></item><item><title>vSphere Immutable Infrastructure with Terraform</title><link>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/vsphere-immutable-infrastructure-with-terraform/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2017 16:56:47 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/vsphere-immutable-infrastructure-with-terraform/</guid><description>What is immutable infrastructure? Immutable infrastructure is the concept of utilizing an infrastructure component in an ephemeral manner. This means that the component can be destroyed and recreated at will without major impact.
Advantages
Troublesome instances can easily be destroyed and recreated. System patching processes are replaced by just provisioning instances from a new template.</description></item><item><title>Jenkins Job Builder</title><link>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/jenkins-job-builder/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/jenkins-job-builder/</guid><description>Recently a co-worker of mine (Thanks Ken Erwin) introduced me to Jenkins Job Builder (http://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/) which is a project created by the OpenStack infrastructure team that aims to automate the creation of Jenkins Jobs.
