This simplifies the process of granting workloads access to other cloud services. Think about how an AWS EC2 instance is granted access to write objects to an S3 bucket. An IAM role is assigned to the instance which has a policy that grants the S3 access.</description></item><item><title>HashiCorp Vault Unique AppRole Identity Logging</title><link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/hashicorp-vault-unique-approle-identity-logging/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/hashicorp-vault-unique-approle-identity-logging/</guid><description>HashiCorp Vault supports several authentication methods for human and non-human access. Several of the non-human authentication methods are tied to specific platforms or clouds such as AWS, Kubernetes, Azure, and others. For workloads that are running on non-supported platforms, the AppRole authentication method is typically recommended for authentication. The AppRole method uses a role as the core construct as the name implies.</description></item><item><title>VMware vSphere VM iPXE Boot without DHCP</title><link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/vmware-vsphere-vm-ipxe-boot-without-dhcp/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/vmware-vsphere-vm-ipxe-boot-without-dhcp/</guid><description>Network booting operating systems isnâ€™t a new concept and has been around for years.

The actual process to revoke the root token is fairly straightforward by running the vault token revoke command and providing the root token at the command line.</description></item><item><title>Detecting HashiCorp Vault Root Token Generation</title><link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/detecting-hashicorp-vault-root-token-generation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/detecting-hashicorp-vault-root-token-generation/</guid><description>HashiCorp Vault generates a default root token during installation and best practice dictates that the token should be revoked once the deployment has been setup. There are certain critical operations that can only be carried out by a root token and requires that a new root token be generated. Given the immense power that the root token garners it would be ideal to identify when a root token is generated.</description></item><item><title>Detecting HashiCorp Vault Root Login</title><link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/detecting-hashicorp-vault-root-login/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/detecting-hashicorp-vault-root-login/</guid><description>Security of a HashiCorp Vault deployment is of paramount importance given the sensitive nature of the information contained within the platform. During the initial configuration process the root token is used to perform the setup and should be used to create less privileged named accounts. These accounts should be used for day to day administration of the Vault deployment and the root token should only be used in scenarios where it is absolutely necessary.</description></item><item><title>Puppet Bolt Vault Inventory Plugin</title><link>https://www.greenreedtech.com/puppet-bolt-vault-inventory-plugin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.greenreedtech.com/puppet-bolt-vault-inventory-plugin/</guid><description>In this blog post we&amp;rsquo;ll look at the HashiCorp Vault plugin for Puppet Bolt that enables authentication credentials for Bolt to be retrieved from an instance of HashiCorp Vault.
