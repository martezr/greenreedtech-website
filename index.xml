Several of the non-human authentication methods are tied to specific platforms or clouds such as AWS, Kubernetes, Azure, and others. For workloads that are running on non-supported platforms, the AppRole authentication method is typically recommended for authentication. The AppRole method uses a role as the core construct as the name implies.</description></item><item><title>VMware vSphere VM iPXE Boot without DHCP</title><link>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/vmware-vsphere-vm-ipxe-boot-without-dhcp/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/vmware-vsphere-vm-ipxe-boot-without-dhcp/</guid><description>Network booting operating systems isnâ€™t a new concept and has been around for years. Bare metal deployments are typically where network booting is commonly used. Most network cards are equipped with a network boot rom that enables the server to boot from the network using the PXE protocol. The PXE protocol is an old protocol that offers limited functionality.</description></item><item><title>HashiCorp Vault vSphere Authentication with VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA)</title><link>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/hashicorp-vault-vsphere-authentication-with-vmware-event-broker-appliance-veba/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/hashicorp-vault-vsphere-authentication-with-vmware-event-broker-appliance-veba/</guid><description>HashiCorp Vault supports a number of authentication methods including methods that utilize what HashiCorp refers to as a &amp;ldquo;trusted platform&amp;rdquo;. These include public clouds such as AWS, Azure and GCP along with platforms like Kubernetes. This method of authentication simplifies the introduction of the initial credential or secret that a workload must present to Vault by making use of information about itself that it already knows.</description></item><item><title>Martez Reed</title><link>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/author/martez-reed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Feb 2021 10:20:19 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/author/martez-reed/</guid><description>Maecenas sit amet purus eget ipsum elementum venenatis.

During the initial configuration process the root token is used to perform the setup and should be used to create less privileged named accounts. These accounts should be used for day to day administration of the Vault deployment and the root token should only be used in scenarios where it is absolutely necessary.</description></item><item><title>Detecting HashiCorp Vault Root Token Generation</title><link>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/detecting-hashicorp-vault-root-token-generation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/detecting-hashicorp-vault-root-token-generation/</guid><description>HashiCorp Vault generates a default root token during installation and best practice dictates that the token should be revoked once the deployment has been setup. There are certain critical operations that can only be carried out by a root token and requires that a new root token be generated. Given the immense power that the root token garners it would be ideal to identify when a root token is generated.</description></item><item><title>Moving to Morpheus Data</title><link>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/moving-to-morpheus-data/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martezr.github.io/greenreedtech-website/moving-to-morpheus-data/</guid><description>I have made the decision to become the director of technical marketing at Morpheus Data and I start that new position today.
